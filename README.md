# Colors in art

You can explore a landing page on my website [Colors in art](https://kotandy.pro/projects/colors-in-art).

This project was created for personal training purposes, **not** for commercial use.

This site is based on a chapter ‚ÄúColor‚Äù from a book "[Art: The Definitive Visual Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Definitive-Andrew-Graham-Dixon/dp/1465474757)" forward by Ross King.

Once I came across a screenshot of this chapter on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Definitive-Andrew-Graham-Dixon/dp/1465474757) and I came up with to create an interactive minimalistic landing page with information from that screenshot.

My challenge was to design and implement it, furthermore I didn‚Äôt want to use a third-party libraries for animation and color wheel. Creating this project I used technologies such as TypeScript, Sass and Webpack.

My goal was to get a better understanding of `JavaScript`. In addition I wanted to refresh my knowledge in `HTML`, `CSS` and to work with `IntersectionObserver API` and `Canvas API`.

I hope, my little project would be interesting for you üôÉ
