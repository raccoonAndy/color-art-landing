          <h2>Color</h2>
          <p class="lead">Color is often one of the most exciting components of a painting, but what exactly is it?
            Understanding the basic principles of color theory helps you to analyze how artists exploit and manipulate
            it in their work. The use color together with composition, perspective, and light and shade to strengthen
            the impact of the subject matter.</p>

          <h3>Mixing and comparing colors</h3>
          <p>The properties of light make colors visible. Light travels in waves of different lengths, and our eyes (and
            brains) perceive different wavelengths as different colors. The range of wavelengths you can see is called
            the visible spectrum: the shortest visible wavelengths appear as violet, and the longest as red. Artists use
            paint made from powdered pigments that absorb some wavelengths and reflect others. Like all colors in the
            physical world, the colors in a painting are actually the colors of reflected light.</p>

          <h3>The color wheel</h3>
          <p>Artists’ understanding and use color was revolutionized in the 19th century, partly thanks to a French
            chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul. When he was working as the Director of Dyeing at the Gobelins tapestry
            workshops near Paris. Chevreul realized that colors appeared brighter or duller depending upon the color
            they were placed next to in a design. To demonstrate how colors modify each other, Chevreul creates a color
            wheel. It shows the three primary colors — red, yellow, and blue — and various mixtures of secondary colors,
            which are made by mixing two primaries. Chevreul’s theories underpinned the Impressionist painters’ use of
            color in the late 19th century. In earlier centuries. artists had used color intuitively.</p>

          <h2>How artists use color</h2>
          <p>In nature and in art, color has a profound effect on the viewer. Artists can choose and use color
            naturalistically — to recreate the colors the have seen in a landscape, for example. By convention, grass is
            green and water is blue but on a closer look they may be made up of many different colors.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>However, artists do not have to imitate the colors they see in physical world. In both figurative and
            abstract painting, color can be used for its decorative beauty, to create a mood, or to express or arouse an
            emotion. It ca be also be used symbolically.</p>

          <h3>Creating impact</h3>
          <p>Colors that are close together on <a href="#color">the color wheel</a> harmonize with each other when placed side by side in a
            painting. For the opposite effect, to make colors stand out, an artist can use complementary colors, but
            painters instinctively juxtaposed complementaries for centuries before the theory was known.</p>
